1-library inclusion: The code includes two libraries "wire.h"for I2C communication and "LiquiddCrystal_L2C"for controlling an LCD display.
2-LCD Initilization:The LCD is Initilized with specific address and dimensions.
3-Pin Definitions:pins are defined for mode selection,calibration.and rely control.
4-setup:in the setup function 
-serial communcation is initated at a baud rate of 9600
-the lcd is Initilized and the backlight is turned on.
-initial message are displayed in the lcd
-Pin modes are set and relay oins are set to an initial state (in this case,turned off)
5-lppo:in the loop funcation 
-it continuosly checks if the calibration button is pressed.if so triggers the calibration process,which involves toggling the calibration rely,displaying a progress bar on the lcd and then indicating completion.
-it checks if the mode button is pressed and toggles between different modes (stud finder,metal detector,wire detector)by changing the "mod"variable and controling the relay accordingly.it also updates the lcd display with
instructions ,the variable resets to 0.
6-mode switching:the"mod" variable is incremented each time the mode  button is pressed,allowing the system to cycle through different modes.once the last mode is reached,the variable resets 0



-overall,this code sets up a system with an LCD diplay and buttons for mode selrction and calibration,Depending on ths selected mode,diffrent actions are taken,such as activating relays and displaying corresponding messages on the LCD.
